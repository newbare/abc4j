Version 0.3
===========
* NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE, PLEASE UPDATE YOUR CODE FOR THE FOLLOWING CHANGE !!!! :
The getHeight() method in the Note class has been RENAMED to getStrictHeigth()
The getHeight() remains but its meaning has been changed. 
Please refer to the javadoc for further information about those 2 methods.

*NEW : you can now display music scores from your Tune class instances using the
abc.ui.swing.JScore class.
The musical representation still has a lot of limitations (multi notes are 
not displayed, same for chords etc etc), but the basics are here already (imho:).

* Various fixes : 
- issue when moving to JDK 1.5 : midi messages to change the tempo in a midi 
sequence didn't t seem to be recognized by the 1.5 sequencer. I had to work around
this.
- Issue 4 fix : nullpointer exception in tuplets part when parsing.
- Issue 5 fix  : Cb key makes an array out of bounds exception.
- Issue 6 fix : 	isCompound() in time signature has wrong implementation.


Version 0.2
===========
* Lyrics content of abc tunes is now provided from tune score representation.
* Javadoc documentation improvements.
* More reliable implementation of the parser that only parses headers (for a faster parsing).
* New support of non v1.6 standard characters for the text part of abc tunes.
* Clarification of way to express notes duration (see differences between note duration and strict duration).
* Various bug fixes....
