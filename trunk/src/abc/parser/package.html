This package contains classes for parsing tunes in abc notation. It needs both <TT>scanner</TT> and 
<TT>abc.notation</TT> packages to work.
The purpose of classes from this package is to extract from the abc notation all the necessary information needed 
to represent the music with objects belonging to the <TT>abc.notation</TT>.<BR/>
<BR/>
abc4j propose several classes to instantiate abc parsers :
<UL>
	<LI>{@link  abc.parser.AbcFileParser AbcFileParser} :  This class parses the abc stream and 
		provides you {@link  abc.notation.Tune Tune} instances with header information 
		(such as title, key etc...) and music part. 
	</LI>
	<LI>{@link  abc.parser.AbcHeadersParser AbcHeadersParser} : This class restricts the 
		parsing to abc headers. This enables a faster parsing compared to the one 
		done using <TT>AbcFileParser</TT>.
	</LI>
	<LI>{@link  abc.parser.TuneParser TuneParser} : This class is usefull when you 
		want to parse only one tune : you get the {@link  abc.notation.Tune Tune} result in a 
		synchronous manner without any listener mechanism. Quite convenient in some cases...
	</LI>
</UL>
<HR/>
Some specific points should be pointed out during the translation from abc music notation to "standard"
music notation :
<OL>
<LI><B>Several different ways to express music using abc can lead to the same music.</B><BR/>
For instance, the two following tunes :
<PRE>
X:1
T:dots example
L:1/8
K:D
d3d

X:2
T:dots example
L:1/4
K:D
d>d
</PRE>
describe the same melody : a dotted quarter note followed by eighth note. The consequence of this is that their 
representation in <TT>Note</TT> objects will be the same : the first note is a <TT>Note</TT> instance 
whose strict duration is <TT>Note.QUARTER</TT> and its <TT>countDots()</TT> will return 1.<BR/>
The second note is a <TT>Note.EIGHTH</TT> without any dot.<BR/><BR/>
</LI>
<LI><B>Some abc note lengths may be impossible to translate into standard music notation.</B><BR/>
For instance, let's consider the following tune :
<PRE>
X:1
T:impossible duration
L:1/8
K:D
d5
</PRE>
In such tune, the first note has a duration equals to 5 x eighth note. Such duration cannot be expressed
in standard music notation with one single note : a quarter note is 4 times a eighth note, and a dotted
quarter is 6 times a eighth note.<BR/>
For now, the resulting note will be an instance of the <TT>Note</TT> class but with an "exotic" duration.
One possible alternative would be to decompose this duration into several notes, but for now, the 
translation sticks to the approach "one abc note -> one <TT>Note</TT> instance".
