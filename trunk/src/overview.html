		This document is the API specification for the abc4j musical library dedicated 
		to the abc musical notation.<BR>
		The abc4j java library provides API to handle ABC musical notation using java 
		(1.2 but core classes only use 1.1.8).<BR>
		It provides a parser to parse tunes written in ABC notation, 
		and basic other helper classes in order to play them using midi etc etc.<BR>
		It only supports ABC v1.6.<BR>
		The purpose is also to define interfaces that can be implemented in order to
		extend basic capabilities of the library (for instance : improved midi player, 
		musical score display...)<BR>
		The library also includes a Java Application that demonstrates some of the 
		features of the library : ABCynth.<BR>
