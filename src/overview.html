		<BR><BR>RUMBA is also known as "EBL" : Entertainment Business Logic. <BR>
		The purpose of this layer is
		to provide high level interfaces to ease the manipulation of multimedia devices.<BR>
		As those components should be reusable for several customization projects, those interfaces
		should be flexible enough to support very different clients needs.<BR>
		We can distinguish several parts inside RUMBA:
		<UL>
			<LI>Audio Application:
			</LI>
			<LI>MMP Application:
			</LI>
			<LI>VoiceMemo Application:
